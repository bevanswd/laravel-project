<h2>My first laravel project</h2>

<b>What it is:</b>
a message logging system with viewable posts table for logged-in users. Uses a SQL database.
<br>
<b>What it does:</b>
form fill and user management system. posts are saved and logged-in users are able to view all form submissions from the dashboard

<hr>

<small>*Bugs I'm still trying to work out...

1. the 'Select State' dropdown menu stores a number rather than the selected State's initials. displays number.
2. Authentication problem - guest users should be restricted from the posts page. Logged-in user should be restricted from the login page and redirected to the posts page</small>
